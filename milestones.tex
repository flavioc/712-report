\subsubsection{75\% Goal}

A basic working system that is capable of handling link quality changes by assuming a static set of users.

\subsubsection{100\% Goal}

Also handle users that join and leave the system. A comprehensive benchmark of the system.

\subsubsection{125\% Goal}

A system that handles all types of changes in the network including controller failures.
