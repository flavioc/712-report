\subsubsection{75\% Goal}

A basic working system that is capable of handling incoming users and link quality changes.

\subsubsection{100\% Goal}

A system that also handles server failures. A comprehensive benchmark of the system.

\subsubsection{125\% Goal}

A system that handles all types of changes in the network and also controller failures.
