To evaluate our system we will develop a workload generator that creates different benchmarks. These benchmarks will stress different aspects of our system. Most of the scenarios will include: new users joining to system to view a video; a certain percentage of servers dies; quality problems with several links in the system; or one of the controllers dies.

We want to measure the throughput and resilliency in the situations described above. For throughput we have the following metrics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Average bitrate received on each edge server.
\item Average buffering ratio on each edge server.
\item Average join time on each edge server.
\end{itemize}

Finally, the metrics for measuring resilliency are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Recovery time during different type of server failures.
\item Users impacted by a failure.
\end{itemize}
